    "content": "Paper Summary: This paper introduces The AI Scientist, a fully automated pipeline that uses large language models and related tools to conduct the entire scientific research process without human intervention\nreddit.com\n. The system generates novel research ideas, writes and executes code for experiments, analyzes results (including creating figures), and then writes a complete scientific paper describing its findings\nsakana.ai\n. An automated reviewer (an AI agent) is also presented to evaluate the AI-generated papers with near-human accuracy\nsakana.ai\n. The authors demonstrate the approach on three distinct machine learning domains (diffusion models, language modeling (transformers), and learning dynamics) and report that each AI-generated paper can be produced for under $15 in compute cost\nsakana.ai\n. Overall, this work represents a groundbreaking step towards fully automated open-ended scientific discovery in AI research. Originality: The idea of an AI system that autonomously ideates, experiments, and writes research papers is highly novel and ambitious. This is the first comprehensive framework to automate the entire research lifecycle, whereas prior efforts only tackled isolated parts (e.g. automated experiment tuning or paper writing assistance). The paper clearly differentiates itself from previous work by integrating everything into one agent, which is a significant original contribution\nreddit.com\n. Significance: If successful, the impact of this work could be very high. It points to a future where AI agents accelerate scientific discovery by tirelessly exploring ideas and experiments at scale\nsakana.ai\n. In the machine learning community, this system could democratize research (lowering the cost and expertise needed to produce publishable results) and potentially increase the pace of innovation\nsakana.ai\n. The results in the paper show that the AI Scientist can produce papers that meet at least a weak accept standard at top conferences\nreddit.com\n, indicating meaningful progress. This significance is tempered only slightly by the fact that the demonstrated research contributions, while solid, are within existing subfields rather than earth-shattering new discoveries. Technical Quality: The submission appears technically strong. The AI Scientist pipeline is well-designed, combining state-of-the-art components (LLMs for idea generation and writing, code generation tools, search engines for literature, etc.) in a coherent manner. The authors validate the system across multiple case studies, and importantly, they introduce an automated reviewing agent to quantitatively assess the quality of the AI-generated papers\nsakana.ai\n. The methodology is sound: for each domain, the AI-generated papers’ content and evaluations are documented, and the automated reviewer was validated against human reviewer standards (reported to be near-human in scoring accuracy\nsakana.ai\n). The experiments are reproducible (with code and data open-sourced) and the claims—such as achieving conference-level paper quality—are supported by evidence from the automated reviews and example outputs. Overall, the technical execution is thorough, and I did not detect any obvious flaws in the experimental setup or analysis. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized. It provides a logical walkthrough of the system’s components (idea generation, experiment execution, paper write-up, peer review) with sufficient detail for each. The writing is concise and accessible, making it easy to follow how The AI Scientist operates and what results it produced. The inclusion of an example generated paper and a discussion of limitations also helps the reader understand both the capabilities and current shortcomings of the approach. I especially appreciate that the authors clearly state the assumptions, scope, and limitations (like compute cost, use of specific models, etc.), which adds transparency. Strengths:\nAmbitious Vision and Execution: This work tackles a grand challenge – automating scientific research – and delivers a first-ever end-to-end demonstration of an AI conducting research independently\nsakana.ai\n. The integration of idea generation, experimentation, and paper writing in one loop is impressive.\nComprehensive Evaluation: The introduction of an AI-based reviewer to evaluate the generated papers is innovative and valuable. It lends credibility to the results by showing the AI’s papers can be critiqued at a near-human level\nsakana.ai\n. The automated reviews (and their near alignment with human judgment) strengthen confidence in the technical quality of the work.\nGenerality and Versatility: The system is tested on multiple ML subfields (diffusion models, transformers, grokking/learning dynamics), demonstrating versatility across different types of research questions\nsakana.ai\n. This suggests the approach is not limited to a single niche.\nPractical Impact: The fact that each paper costs only about $15 in computation is striking\nsakana.ai\n. This points to a potentially game-changing aspect: scaling up research exploration at low cost. It could democratize research by enabling even those with limited resources to generate and test many ideas.\nTransparency and Reproducibility: The authors have open-sourced the code and provided detailed examples\nsakana.ai\n. They also openly discuss limitations and ethical considerations, which is a positive sign that they are aware of what needs improvement and invite the community to build on or evaluate the work.\nWeaknesses:\nEarly-Stage Limitations: As the authors acknowledge, the current system has some limitations. Notably, The AI Scientist lacks vision capabilities (it cannot interpret its own figures or fix visual layout issues), leading to occasional formatting problems in the generated papers\nsakana.ai\n. It also sometimes makes implementation errors or analytical mistakes (e.g., mis-comparing numerical results) that could yield misleading conclusions\nsakana.ai\n. These issues mean that human oversight is still needed to catch errors, at least in this version.\nReliance on Automated Reviewer: The evaluation of the generated papers’ quality leans heavily on the automated reviewer’s judgment. While that reviewer model is reported to be near-human, it’s still an AI evaluation developed by the authors’ team. This raises a slight concern of potential bias or overestimation of the paper quality – an independent human evaluation (e.g., anonymous peer reviewers) would strengthen the claims. In its absence, we have to trust the authors’ automated metric that the papers would exceed acceptance threshold\nreddit.com\n.\nIncremental Research Contributions: The research ideas produced, though novel in formulation, appear to be incremental improvements or explorations within well-studied areas (e.g., a tweak on diffusion model training, or a variation on transformer language models). They are valuable as proofs of concept, but none stand out as a breakthrough finding in and of themselves. This is understandable given the goal, but it means the scientific contributions of the AI-generated papers might be on the modest side.\nScope of Applicability: The system is demonstrated on machine learning research problems that are conducive to automated experimentation (with existing codebases and benchmarks). It’s unclear how well this approach would generalize to research in other fields, especially those requiring creativity beyond the AI’s training data or involving non-simulation experiments. This is not a fault per se, but it does limit the immediate impact to similar domains.\nEthical/Societal Implications: While not a direct reason to reject, it’s worth noting the broader concerns: if such AI-generated papers become common, they could flood conferences with submissions or strain the peer review process\nsakana.ai\n. The authors do mention this and the need for transparency. It will be important to manage these implications (perhaps by marking AI-generated content) as the technology matures.\nQuestions for Authors:\nValidation by Human Reviewers: Did you have any of the AI-generated papers evaluated by human experts (outside the author team)? For example, was a human peer-review simulation done (perhaps via a double-blind review by colleagues or workshop submission) to confirm the automated reviewer’s scores? This would help confirm that the AI reviewer’s “near-human” performance is truly reliable and that the generated papers would likely be accepted by actual conference reviewers.\nEnsuring Novelty: How does The AI Scientist ensure that the research ideas it generates are genuinely novel and not just minor variations of known ideas? You mention using Semantic Scholar to avoid duplication\nsakana.ai\n; could you elaborate on how effective this was? Were there instances where the AI proposed something that turned out to already exist in literature, and how was that handled?\nHandling Errors and Revisions: The system sometimes makes mistakes in implementation or analysis (e.g., misreading results, code errors)\nsakana.ai\n. What mechanisms are in place for the AI to detect and correct its own errors? For instance, if an experiment’s results don’t make sense or a plotted graph is blank, can the AI Scientist revise the code or analysis automatically, or is human intervention needed at that point?\nFuture Integration: Do you plan to integrate multi-modal capabilities into future versions (so that the AI Scientist can understand figures/plots and adjust formatting)\nsakana.ai\n? This seems crucial for improving the quality of the generated papers. Also, are there plans to broaden the scope beyond purely computational experiments – or is the vision that this would mostly aid fields like ML where simulation is possible?\nEthics and Transparency: You discussed the risk of misuse (like overloading the submission system or potential biases from automated reviews)\nsakana.ai\n. Could you share any concrete ideas on how the community might implement safeguards? For example, do you suggest papers disclose if they were AI-generated, or that conference policies adapt in some way?",

## Example 2: Critical (Reject)
{
    "content":"Paper Summary: The submission proposes “The AI Scientist”, an automated system intended to perform the full cycle of scientific research using AI tools. It combines a large language model-driven agent that can generate research ideas, write code to run experiments, analyze the outcomes, and then write a research paper about the results\nreddit.com\n. Additionally, the authors introduce an AI-based peer reviewer that evaluates the quality of the generated papers and provides feedback\nsakana.ai\n. They test this system on three machine learning topics (diffusion models, transformer language models, and learning dynamics/grokking) and claim that the AI-generated papers can achieve a quality equivalent to conference submissions (reaching a “weak accept” threshold according to their automated reviewer)\nreddit.com\n. The ultimate goal is to show a proof-of-concept that an AI can autonomously discover and disseminate new scientific knowledge. Originality: Automating scientific research is an intriguing goal, and this work is one of the first attempts to unify several AI capabilities into a single research pipeline. However, in terms of fundamental novelty, the paper mostly repackages existing techniques (LLMs for text generation, code synthesis, and literature search) into a workflow. The idea of using AI to aid in research isn’t entirely new – what’s new here is the claim of full autonomy in doing all steps end-to-end. While that end-to-end integration is novel, I feel the conceptual leap is not as large as it sounds; it’s largely an engineering integration of known components rather than a breakthrough in AI algorithms or learning theory. Significance: The potential long-term significance could be high (if we truly had AI agents reliably conducting research, it would revolutionize the field). But the immediate significance of this paper’s results is unclear. The actual research outputs produced by the AI (the example papers) do not seem to advance the state of the art in their respective subfields in a notable way – they are, at best, incremental findings or re-discoveries. Furthermore, claiming that the AI’s papers exceed a conference acceptance bar based on an automated evaluation is not entirely convincing. Without validation from human reviewers or significant novel discoveries, the work’s impact remains speculative. In its current form, I view this as an interesting prototype, but not yet a contribution that will change how research is done in the near term. Technical Quality: I have significant concerns about the technical soundness of the evaluation and some aspects of the approach. While the system design is described, there is a lack of clarity on crucial details:\nThe automated reviewer is central to the claims, yet we only have the authors’ assertion that it achieves “near-human performance” in scoring\nsakana.ai\n. We don’t know how this was validated (e.g., how it correlates with actual human judgments). This is problematic because the paper’s main success metric (that the AI-generated papers would be accepted) hinges on this reviewer’s output.\nThere are known failure modes admitted in the paper: the AI Scientist can produce incorrect implementations, flawed analyses, or formatting errors that the system doesn’t catch\nsakana.ai\n. However, it’s not clearly documented how often these occurred or how severely they affected the results. If the system sometimes draws wrong conclusions (e.g., misreading a graph or making an unfair baseline comparison), that calls into question the reliability of the conclusions in its generated papers.\nThe examples provided (like the “Adaptive Dual-Scale Denoising” paper mentioned) are said to contain flaws in interpretation or reasoning\nsakana.ai\n. Yet, the paper under review doesn’t quantify how many flaws are present on average or whether the automated reviewer can detect them. This makes me uncertain about the soundness of the results — are we looking at papers that merely look plausible, or papers that have been verified to be correct and reproducible? The authors do mention that all experimental results are saved for reproducibility, which is good, but we are not shown an independent verification of those results.\nOn the positive side, the authors did undertake a substantial engineering effort, and the system’s pipeline is logically structured. The case studies are relevant. But the lack of rigorous evaluation (beyond the AI reviewer’s assessment) is a major weakness in technical quality.\nClarity: The paper is written in a generally understandable way, but certain parts need more clarity and detail. For example, the description of the automated review process and how the scores are generated is insufficient for the reader to trust that component. I also found that the discussion of results focuses on high-level claims (e.g., “exceeds acceptance threshold”) without providing concrete evidence like sample scores from human evaluators or specific examples of the AI’s novel findings. The method section would benefit from a clearer breakdown of the algorithmic steps the AI takes in each phase (perhaps pseudocode or a flowchart). Additionally, some important terms (like what constitutes an “acceptance threshold” in numeric terms) are not clearly defined in the text. On the whole, while I grasped the broad idea, the lack of detail in crucial parts made it difficult to fully assess the work. Strengths:\nBold Vision: The paper addresses a highly ambitious goal: fully automated scientific discovery. This big-picture vision is inspiring, even if not fully realized yet. It pushes the boundary of what we think AI can do in the research process.\nIntegrated System: The authors present an end-to-end system and reportedly open-sourced it. This engineering effort could be valuable; having the code available means the community can experiment with it, potentially reproducing or building upon the approach. The system could serve as a baseline for future research on automated science assistants.\nCost Efficiency: The process is notably cost-efficient in the examples given (approximately $15 of compute per paper\nsakana.ai\n). This is a strong point if the method were to be scaled up; it implies that running many experiments or generating many hypothesis-tests is feasible even for those without massive resources.\nWeaknesses:\nQuestionable Evaluation Claims: The primary evidence for success is that an AI reviewer (created by the authors) labels the AI-generated papers as above a certain threshold. This is a very circular evaluation – essentially using one AI to validate another, without external checks. As a reviewer, I am not convinced by the claim of “near-human performance” of the reviewer model without seeing a rigorous comparison to actual human reviews or ratings\nsakana.ai\n. The paper does not mention any human study or benchmark for the reviewer's judgments. This is a critical weakness because it undermines trust in all the results.\nLack of Notable Scientific Contribution: From the perspective of the NeurIPS audience, the paper does not present a clear scientific breakthrough or a new algorithm. The core contribution is an assembly of existing techniques into a pipeline. The individual research results produced (the example papers) appear to be incremental and not competitive with human-authored research in terms of insights. In other words, this submission is more about the system architecture than about new knowledge in AI or ML – which might be acceptable if the system was evaluated thoroughly, but as noted, that evaluation is weak.\nTechnical Reliability Issues: The AI Scientist, in its current form, has several reliability issues that cast doubt on the robustness of the approach. It cannot understand or adjust visual content (leading to messed-up figures/tables)\nsakana.ai\n. It can produce wrong code or incorrect analyses (e.g., mis-comparing metrics) without realizing it\nsakana.ai\n. These are non-trivial problems; a single undetected error could invalidate an entire paper’s conclusions. The authors’ solution is mainly to log everything, but prevention or correction of such errors is not demonstrated. This weakens the soundness of the results – the papers might contain undetected errors.\nClarity and Detail: Important implementation details are glossed over. For example, how exactly is idea generation guided? How are literature searches integrated? What prompts or algorithms ensure the AI stays on track? The reliance on proprietary models (GPT-4 variants, etc.) also makes it hard to know how reproducible the approach is for others who may not have access. The clarity issue means it’s hard to tell what the key technical insights are that the reader should take away and reuse.\nEthical/Societal Risks: While not the main focus of the decision, I want to note that deploying a system like this has potential negative consequences (and the paper itself notes some). For instance, an influx of AI-generated papers could overwhelm the peer review system or introduce a lot of low-quality, auto-generated content\nsakana.ai\n. The paper mentions these concerns but doesn’t offer a concrete mitigation strategy. This work treads into new territory and I worry about recommending acceptance without a clearer discussion of how to prevent misuse.\nQuestions for Authors:\nHuman Evaluation of Output: Have you conducted any blind evaluations of the AI-generated papers with real human reviewers (for example, submitting to a workshop or asking experts to rate them)? If not, why was this not done? This would greatly strengthen the case that the papers are of publishable quality, rather than relying on your AI reviewer’s assessment.\nDetails on Automated Reviewer: How exactly is the automated reviewer implemented and trained? Is it just another LLM prompted to review, or did you fine-tune a model on peer review data? What evidence do you have that it correlates well with actual reviewer decisions (any stats or examples)? This is crucial because all your quality claims rest on this component.\nNovelty of Research Discoveries: Can you give concrete examples of something genuinely new that The AI Scientist discovered which was not already known? For instance, in the diffusion model experiment or the transformer experiment, did the AI come up with a hypothesis or result that surprised the authors or introduced a new state-of-the-art result? It’s hard to tell if the system is discovering new knowledge or just churning variations of known themes.\nHandling of Errors: The paper acknowledges issues like code errors, result misinterpretation, etc. How does the system respond when these occur? Is there any self-correction loop if a result seems off, or does the AI just proceed with potentially flawed data? For example, if a plotted graph is blank or a baseline score is higher than the new method (indicating failure), will the AI notice and adjust, or only a human could catch that?\nScope beyond ML & Future Work: To what extent do you think The AI Scientist could be applied to domains outside of machine learning (say physics experiments, biology, etc.)? Currently it’s dependent on code execution and simulations. What modifications would be needed to handle research that involves physical experiments or more abstract theorization? This would help understand the limitations of the approach and the next steps.\nOverall Score: 3/10 (Reject).\nConfidence: 3/5 (Fair). While I understand the paper, the topic spans multiple sub-areas (AutoML, NLP, meta-science) and I am not an expert in all of them. I am reasonably confident in the core concerns raised, but would remain open to discussion if evidence is provided during rebuttal.",

## Example 3: Borderline (Weak Accept)
{
    "content":"Paper Summary: The paper presents The AI Scientist, an AI-driven system aimed at fully automating the research process, from idea generation all the way to writing a research paper. The system leverages state-of-the-art large language models and other AI tools to brainstorm novel research hypotheses, write and run code for experiments, analyze the results (including generating figures), and compose a manuscript describing the findings\nsakana.ai\n. A notable component is an automated peer-reviewer AI, which evaluates the generated papers and provides feedback, simulating the review process. The authors demonstrate this pipeline on multiple machine learning case studies (e.g., a diffusion model experiment, a transformer model analysis, and a study of learning dynamics) and report that the AI’s papers approach a quality that would merit acceptance at a top conference, as judged by their AI reviewer (approximately “weak accept” level)\nsakana.ai\n. The work is positioned as a first step towards open-ended, autonomous scientific discovery using AI. Originality: The concept of an “AI Scientist” – an autonomous agent that can conduct research – is highly original in its complete scope. While there has been work on automating pieces of research (such as hyperparameter tuning, experiment suggestion, or paper writing assistants), this is the first work (to my knowledge) that attempts to integrate all these pieces and demonstrate an end-to-end autonomous research cycle. The novelty here is not in each individual component (which largely build on existing advanced AI capabilities) but in the holistic combination and the open-ended use of the system to iteratively generate new knowledge. That said, because it builds on known techniques (LLMs, etc.), some might view it more as an impressive application/system paper rather than a fundamentally new algorithm – but as a system, it’s novel. Significance: The long-term vision driving this work has considerable significance: if AI agents can eventually conduct research autonomously, it could vastly accelerate scientific progress and change the methodology of experimentation. In the short term, the significance is moderate but non-trivial – this paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept that such an AI researcher can produce outputs that are comparable to human work (at least at a workshop or weaker conference level). This could inspire many follow-up projects and spark discussions about the future of AI in research. However, the immediate contributions (the specific papers generated) are of somewhat limited scope (incremental findings in well-known ML problems). They are valuable as a validation of the approach, but on their own those findings likely wouldn’t be significant enough for NeurIPS if not for the context that they were AI-generated. Thus, the significance lies in the approach and validation thereof, rather than in new scientific knowledge produced. Technical Quality: The technical execution is a mixed bag: on one hand, the authors succeed in building a working system that does produce coherent papers and results, which is a commendable engineering feat. They also incorporate an evaluation mechanism (the automated reviewer) and discuss many implementation details. The experiments across three domains show that the approach is feasible in different scenarios, and the fact that the AI’s papers were at least somewhat convincing is notable. On the other hand, there are some questions on rigor:\nThe automated reviewer's evaluation, while useful, is not as reassuring as a human evaluation. The paper would be stronger if at least a subset of the results were verified by human reviewers or by comparing to known ground truth (e.g., for a baseline problem, did the AI rediscover a known result correctly?).\nSome technical problems are acknowledged (like errors in reading plots or code mistakes\nsakana.ai\n), but it’s not fully clear how they impact the final outcomes or how often the AI Scientist needed interventions. The robustness of the pipeline isn’t quantified – e.g., how many attempts or iterations were needed to get a successful paper in each domain?\nThe methodology for idea generation and ensuring novelty could use more explanation. Using Semantic Scholar to filter ideas is mentioned, but we don’t see analysis of how well that worked. The technical quality of the ideas themselves (are they good ideas or nonsense?) is not deeply evaluated aside from the fact that something was implementable.\nIn summary, the work is technically sound in building what it set out to build, but the evaluation and analysis of the system’s performance could be more thorough. It’s an early exploration of a new direction, so some evaluation gaps are understandable, but they leave some uncertainty about results.\nClarity: Overall, the paper is clearly structured and relatively easy to follow. The authors do a good job breaking down the system into its components and describing each stage of The AI Scientist’s process. The writing is straightforward, and the inclusion of examples (like excerpts from an AI-generated paper, and discussion of a specific run) helps illustrate the approach. The paper also includes a section on limitations and ethical considerations\nsakana.ai\nsakana.ai\n, which is very useful for transparency. A few areas could be clearer:\nI would have appreciated a more detailed description (perhaps a figure or algorithm listing) of the control flow: how does the system decide on an idea, when does it stop iterating, how the reviewer feedback is fed back in, etc. The high-level description is given, but finer details would help reproduce or fully comprehend the mechanism.\nThe results section could be clearer about what was achieved in each case study. For instance, summarizing the key finding of each AI-generated paper and any metrics (did the AI’s new method outperform a baseline? By how much?) would allow readers to gauge the success more concretely.\nThese are relatively minor clarity issues. The paper is mostly well-written.\nStrengths:\nFirst-of-Its-Kind Integration: This work pioneers the integration of multiple AI functionalities into one autonomous system for research. That holistic approach is novel and could open up a new subfield of research automation. The successful demonstration across different tasks shows the generality of the idea.\nComprehensive Presentation: The authors provide a thorough explanation of the system and even openly discuss its limitations and challenges\nsakana.ai\n. This honesty about what doesn’t work yet lends credibility and gives direction for future improvements. They also touch on ethical implications\nsakana.ai\n, showing they have thought about the broader impact.\nMulti-Domain Case Studies: Showing results on three varied ML problems strengthens the work. It’s a good proof that the AI Scientist isn’t a one-trick pony for a single benchmark, but a framework that can be applied to various research questions (at least within ML). This generality is a significant strength for a system paper.\nOpen Source and Reproducibility: The authors have reportedly released the code and detailed results on GitHub\nsakana.ai\n. This is a strong positive for the community: others can inspect what was done, reproduce the experiments, and build upon the system. It increases the paper’s usefulness and trustworthiness.\nFuture Potential: The paper, despite some weaknesses, lays a foundation that others can improve upon. It hints at interesting future directions, like adding vision capabilities, addressing safety, using better models, etc. I view this as a strength in that it establishes a baseline and roadmap for an important line of inquiry.\nWeaknesses:\nEvaluation Dependence on AI Reviewer: A recurring concern is that the evaluation is not third-party. The automated reviewer might share the same biases as the generator (both being language models) and could be more forgiving or blind to certain flaws. Without a human evaluation, we can’t be entirely sure the AI-generated papers truly meet NeurIPS standards (the paper asserts near-human review performance, but more evidence would be needed to solidify that claim).\nLimited Novelty in Results: The research findings produced by the AI, as presented, seem incremental. For example, the diffusion model paper’s idea or the “grokking” analysis might not reveal much that an experienced researcher in those areas would consider new. The value here is more that an AI did it rather than what was discovered. This is acceptable for a system paper, but it means the paper’s contribution is tied to the system’s promise rather than immediate scientific insights.\nKnown Technical Issues: The current system has notable technical issues. It cannot interpret its own figures or layouts (no vision), leading to sometimes messy output\nsakana.ai\n. It can make logical mistakes (like misreading numerical results or failing to adjust code timeouts properly)\nsakana.ai\n. The authors did not demonstrate solutions to these issues, only noted them. As a result, the system still requires human supervision to ensure quality, which limits its claimed autonomy.\nGeneralizability and Scope: All demonstrations are in the field of machine learning, where plenty of data and compute are available, and experiments are easily automated. It remains unclear how well this approach would work in less “AI-friendly” sciences (e.g., experimental sciences that aren’t just code-based, or theoretical work that requires insight beyond pattern recognition). The paper doesn’t explore these boundaries, so the contribution might be narrower than the grand title implies (focused on automating ML research specifically, at least for now).\nReproducibility of Reviewer’s Judgment: While code is released, one weakness is we don’t have a clear benchmark of how the automated reviewer would score other papers or how consistent it is. If others run the AI Scientist, will the reviewer always give high scores? Or could the authors have inadvertently tuned it to rate their AI’s outputs favorably? There’s a slight worry of reproducibility in the evaluation metric itself that remains unaddressed.\nQuestions for Authors:\nHuman vs AI Reviewer: Did you perform any side-by-side comparisons of the AI reviewer’s judgments with those of real human reviewers on the same paper? For instance, if the AI Scientist’s output paper was given to a person, would they also rate it as a weak accept? Some concrete data here would help validate the claim of near-human reviewer performance\nsakana.ai\n.\nQuality of Generated Papers: Can you provide more detail on the quality of the content in the AI-generated papers? For example: How was the writing style (did it require heavy editing to read well)? Were the references appropriate and relevant? Did the AI introduce any incorrect statements or justifiable claims without evidence? Essentially, beyond the high-level score, what do these papers look like in terms of quality to a reader?\nIteration Process: The paper mentions the process can be repeated iteratively in an open-ended fashion. In your experiments, did you actually iterate (have the AI Scientist use feedback to generate a second-generation paper)? If so, what improvements were seen in a second iteration? If not, how do you envision this iterative improvement working, and what signals would the system use to decide to pursue a new iteration versus move to the next idea?\nError Handling: One of the listed weaknesses is critical errors in writing and evaluating results (like struggling to compare magnitudes of numbers)\nsakana.ai\n. What steps could be taken to improve this in the future? For example, would integrating a symbolic or arithmetic checker, or a visual reasoning module, help? I’m curious if the authors have thoughts on how to make the AI Scientist more robust against such errors, as that seems necessary for higher-stakes research.\nPreventing Misuse: Given the concerns that an AI could mass-produce papers or possibly conduct unsafe research autonomously\nsakana.ai\n,\nsakana.ai\n, do the authors have any recommendations on policy or safety frameworks? This might be outside the scope of the technical paper, but since it’s touched on in the discussion, any thoughts on how to keep this beneficial (e.g., watermarking AI-generated content, oversight mechanisms) would be interesting.\nOverall Score: 6/10 (Weak Accept). Rationale: This paper is borderline; it has some clear weaknesses in evaluation and a contribution that is more futuristic than immediately practical. However, it is also exploring a brave new direction and offers a lot of value as a starting point for automated research agents. On balance, I lean slightly towards acceptance because it could stimulate important discussion and follow-up work, despite my reservations. Confidence: 3/5 (Fairly confident). I have knowledge of automated machine learning and AI-driven text generation, which allows me to assess many parts of the paper, but some aspects (like the precise performance of the AI reviewer and the novelty in each domain) are hard to judge without additional data. I am open to being convinced further either way during the rebuttal.",
